# pagination-in-nodejs
Hello. In order to understand the logic of pagination with Node.js, I took care to write the codes very easy. 

To run the server, simply type "npm start" into the terminal.  

Technologies used in the project: 
Node.js 
Express.js 
EJS 
axios 
bulma.io 

In this project: 
There is a home page where the pictures are randomly brought. Then, when you clicked on the "read more" link, I redirected you to the blog detail page. 

Moreover, pagination buttons in the navbar area of the page. 
There is only one error in the codes, and it appears when we make a GET request to the "http://localhost:3000/blogs" link. If I searched for the reason, I would have found it, but I want you to find it by searching the codes and send it to me by email...
